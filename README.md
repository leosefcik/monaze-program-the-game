MOŇÁZE
the
GAME

The basics:
Each time you start, you get your basic values, which are:
Money (100-200 but it changes with difficulty)
Happiness (50)
Reputation (50)
Health (100)

Once money reaches 0, you lose!
Once happiness reaches 0, you lose!
Once reputation reaches 0, you lose!
Once health reaches 0, you lose!

The goal is to survive as many turns as possible (and possibly unlock possible achievements that will possibly be added in possible future updates)

Each turn, many things happen.
- You pay for rent and stuff
- Your happiness naturally goes a bit down
- You work (if you have work)
- A random event randomly happens. This can be something devastating, something very nice, something very illegal or something very lucky.

Every time an event happens, you can either answer with yes/accept when you enter "y", and answer with no/decline by entering anything else than "y".
